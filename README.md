## Introduction

We present a computational approach to understanding how empathy is expressed in online mental health platforms. We develop a novel unifying theoretically-grounded framework for characterizing the communication of empathy in text-based conversations. We collect and share a corpus of 10k (post, response) pairs annotated using this empathy framework with supporting evidence for annotations (rationales). We develop a multi-task RoBERTa-based bi-encoder model for identifying empathy in conversations and extracting rationales underlying its predictions. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can effectively
identify empathic conversations. We further apply this model to analyze 235k mental health interactions and show that users do not self-learn empathy over time, revealing opportunities for empathy training and feedback.

## Quickstart

### 1. Prerequisites

Our framework can be compiled on Python 3 environments. The modules used in our code can be installed using:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 2. Prepare dataset
A sample raw input data file is available in [dataset/sample_input_ER.csv](dataset/sample_input_ER.csv). This file (and other raw input files in the [dataset](dataset) folder) can be converted into a format that is recognized by the model using with following command:
```
$ python3 src/process_data.py --input_path dataset/sample_input_ER.csv --output_path dataset/sample_input_model_ER.csv
```

### 3. Training the model
For training our model on the sample input data, run the following command:
```
$ python3 src/train.py \
	--train_path=dataset/sample_input_model_ER.csv \
	--lr=2e-5 \
	--batch_size=32 \
	--lambda_EI=1.0 \
	--lambda_RE=0.5 \
	--save_model \
	--save_model_path=output/sample.pth
```

### 4. Testing the model
For testing our model on the sample test input, run the following command from nlpg01, replacing sample_text_{in, out}put.csv with a file we used, such as political_tweets.csv (input) and output_political_tweets.csv:
```
$ python3 src/test.py \
	--input_path dataset/political_tweets.csv \
	--output_path dataset/political_output.csv \
	--ER_model_path /local1/emazuh/output/reddit-emotion-pretrained.pth \
	--IP_model_path /local1/emazuh/output/reddit-interpretation-pretrained.pth \
	--EX_model_path /local1/emazuh/output/reddit-exploration-pretrained.pth
```

## Dataset Access Instructions

The Reddit portion of our collected dataset is available inside the [dataset](dataset) folder. The csv files with annotations on the three empathy communication mechanisms are `emotional-reactions-reddit.csv`, `interpretations-reddit.csv`, and `explorations-reddit.csv`. Each csv file contains six columns:
```
sp_id: Seeker post identifier
rp_id: Response post identifier
seeker_post: A support seeking post from an online user
response_post: A response/reply posted in response to the seeker_post
level: Empathy level of the response_post in the context of the seeker_post
rationales: Portions of the response_post that are supporting evidences or rationales for the identified empathy level. Multiple portions are delimited by '|'
```
